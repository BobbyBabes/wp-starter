Developer Note
===

Ongoing additions to _s starter theme for my personal setup. Includes gulp. Within gulp it parsing the scss file, autoprefixing, minifying css and injecting css through browsersync.

Within the theme is flexslider, fontawesome and other useful jquery plugins to get started.

This will keep growing!
