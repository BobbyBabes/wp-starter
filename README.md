Developer Note
===

Ongoing additions to _s starter theme for my personal setup. Includes gulp. Within gulp it is parsing the scss file, autoprefixing, renaming and minifying the css file.

Within the theme is fontawesome, flexslider and some other useful scripts and plugins I typically use on projects.

This will keep evolving!
